         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">F</seg>oraſmuch; as a conſiderable number of Brewers for themſelves; and in behalf of the remanent Brewers within the Town of <hi>Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> and the Shires of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Haddingtoun,</hi> have propoſed and deſired, that they may be allowed to ſell the Ale and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beer for this preſent year, at twenty pennies the pynt, with the addition of the Exciſe and Impoſition granted in behalf of the Town of <hi>Edinburgh:</hi> And, ſeing according to the proportion ſetled by the late Act of Parliament, and Proclamations, for regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the prices of Ale and Drinking-beer, when the Ale and Drinking-beer is ſold at twenty pennies the pynt, with the addition foreſaid, the Beer ought to be eight pound the boll. And the ſaids Brewers have propoſed, that in regard they have conſiderable quantities of Victual upon their hand bought of the cropt 1675. at high prices, not yet conſumed, ſo that for this year they cannot come the vvhole length of eighth pound, which is the Rule and Standard appointed by the Proclamation: And therefore deſiring the Council might diſpenſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with ſo far, as that they may be able to brew with ſome ſmall advantage; And ſeing the ſaids Brewers have conſented that the price of the boll of good and ſufficient bear, ſhall be betwixt ſeven and eight pounds, and not below ſeven pound for the boll of all Bear that is to be browen and made in Malt of the Cropt and year, 1676, laſt by paſt. And it being moſt juſt and reaſonable, that all Brewers, great and ſmall, ſhould be in an equal and like condition, as to the price of the drink to be ſold by them, and the price of the Bear of which the ſame is made; which cannot be practicable, if they ſhould be permitted to buy Bear at different prices, in reſpect, theſe who buy bear below the foreſaid price, may under-ſell theſe that do buy the Bear at the ſame: and ſo may enhance and engroſſe to themſelves the trade and benefit of Brewing, to the prejudice and ruine of others; And for preventing the inconvenience and prejudice foreſaid, It is thought neceſſary, and is propoſed and deſired by the ſaids Brewers, that the ſaid price ſhould be ſetled as a juſt and uniform price to be payed for this year by all Brewers and Malt-men, who ſhall buy bear for brewing or making of malt within the ſaid Town and Shires, and that of their own conſent they ſhould be obliged, and grant bonds to the effect foreſaid. And becauſe diverſe perſons, who ſell and tap Wine or are Cooks or Stablers, do brew: and upon occaſion of their Trades and Employments fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaids, do tap and ſell Ale and drinking bear, browen by themſelves, whereby they may ſell their drink with greater advantage then other Brewers that muſt ſhare and divide betwixt them and Tapſters the benefit, that the ſaids perſons will have intirely to themſelves, and ſo may under-ſell the other Brewers, to their prejudice and ruine: And whereas, notwithſtanding of the ſaid Proclamation, the ſmaller Brewers, whoſe ſurvey rolls were under two Bolls, have not given Band to one of His Majeſties Privy Council, and obtained licence betwixt and the day therein appointed, and ſo have forefaulted the benefit of brewing. The Lords of His Majeſties Privy Council, in Proſecution of the ſaid Act of Parliament and Proclamations foreſaids, do here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by diſcharge any perſon or perſons, Brewers great or ſmall within the Burgh of <hi>Edinburgh, Leith</hi> and <hi>Cannongate,</hi> or Suburbs thereof, or within the ſaids Shires of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> or <hi>Haddingtoun</hi> to take upon them, upon pretext of any former licence granted to them, or upon any other pretext or ground whatſoever, to brew any Ale or Drinking-beer, untill they firſt ſubſcrive the ſaid Bond; and upon ſubſcriving thereof, obtain a licence for that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect from the Lords of His Majeſties Privy Council, or Committee appointed by them, which perſons, ſubſcriving the ſaid Bond, and receiving li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence as aforeſaid, are hereby allowed, not only to brew ſingle Ale at the price of twenty pennies the pynt, with the addit on as aforeſaid, but alſo to brew double or three ſhilling Ale; provided, that they who brew the double Ale, ſhall be obliged alſo to brew the ſingle Ale, In which caſe, The ſaids Lords have in ſo far diſpenſed with the ſaid Proclamation in the behalf of the ſaids Brewers, upon the conſiderations foreſaids, until the firſt day of <hi>January,</hi> 1678. And whereas Malt-men and others, who take upon them to make Malt within the ſaids bounds; do exact far greater rates, betwixt the price of the Boll of Beer, and the Boll of Malt, then what is allowed by the ancient Laws made in that behalf; The ſaids Lords do hereby diſcharge any perſon whatſomever within the ſaids bounds to make Malt, untill they find caution acted in the Books of Council, that they ſhall buy the Bear at the price foreſaid for this preſent year: and that they ſhall take no more but half a mark betwixt the Boll of Bear and the Boll of Malt, conform to the Acts of Parliament, and obtain licence for that effect as aforeſaid, as they will be anſwerable on their perill: And in regard, that divers perſons within the City of <hi>Edinburgh, Leith, Cannongate, Abbay, Caldtoun, Craigend, Yeard-heads, New-haven, Pleaſants,</hi> and <hi>St. Ninians<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raw,</hi> who are Ventiners of Wine, Cooks or Stablers do both brew, and tap and ſell Ale and Drinking-bear browen by themſelves, whereby they may ſell their drink with greater advantage then other Brewers; and ſo may underſell the other Brewers to their great hurt and prejudice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſaids Lords do hereby diſcharge any Ventiners of Wine, Cooks or Stablers in the ſaids Bounds, to vent or retail any Ale or Drinking-beer, or if they continue in retailing, to quite their Brewing as they will be anſwerable at their perill. And whereas both Brewers, Ventiners and the Leidges ſuſtain great dammage by the unequal meaſure of Barrels, ſome being above meaſure, and ſome under, occaſioned chiefly by the neglect and fault of Coupers: The ſaids Lords do hereby ordain all Coupers that makes any Brewers Casks, to make their Casks no bigger, nor with the addition of a Chopin to each Gallon: Ordaining every Couper to put his own mark upon his own work, that the Contraveeners may be known; and that all Casks already made be juſted and made equal, betwixt and the firſt day of <hi>May</hi> next, as the ſaids Coupers and Brewers will be anſvverable at their peril: And ordains theſe preſents to be printed and publiſhed at the Mercat Croſs of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> and other places needful, that none pretend ignorance.</p>
